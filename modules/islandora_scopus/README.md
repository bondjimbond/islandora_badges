# Islandora Scopus

## Introduction

Islandora Scopus provides a Scopus Citation Count badge for use with Islandora Badges

Take note: 
- You do NOT need to be a Scopus subscriber to use or view the Scopus piece. You can [get a Scopus API key for free](http://dev.elsevier.com/sc_apis.html).

**The Scopus piece** uses the [Scopus Abstract Citation Count API](https://api.elsevier.com/documentation/AbstractCitationCountAPI.wadl). A default API key is included, but this is intended for demo purposes only and is very limited. You should [get your own free API key from Scopus](https://dev.elsevier.com/apikey/create).

Badges will only display on objects that have a DOI (digital object identifier). The xpath to the DOI field is configurable.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Islandora Scholar](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_scholar)
* [Islandora Badges](../)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)
* Probably a given for most repositories, but your objects must have a MODS datastream

## Installation

Configuration path is admin/islandora/tools/badges/scopus (Administration > Islandora > Islandora Utility Modules > Islandora Badges Configuration > Scopus).

There is one administration fields:

* Scopus API Key
     * Required to acquire citation counts. Do not use the included default in production - it's for demo purposes only. 
     * You can get a [free API key](https://dev.elsevier.com/apikey/create) without subscribing


Once enabled the badge is displayed on pages that have a DOI as configured and some metrics.  If it has a DOI, but doesn't display, then the article doesn't currently have any metrics.
